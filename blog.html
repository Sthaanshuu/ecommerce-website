			<h4>T E C H N O L O G Y</h4>
			<p>Technological innovations, inventions, and engineering applications used within societies to perform specific  tasks have both aided and hampered ancient and modern human civilizations. Technological innovations have become necessary for societies to thrive and evolve, while human societies' culture, ideals, and aspirations have shaped how those civilizations have created, benefited from, and been hampered by technology. These technologies alter how societies behave and operate, which has an impact on and evolves their economies, potentially creating a greater need for more technology, resulting in a cycle. Technology has an impact on how people communicate, learn, and think. It benefits society and influences how people interact with one another on a daily basis. Today's society is heavily reliant on technology. It has both positive and negative effects on the world and has an impact on people's daily lives. We live in a time when technological advances are common. Cell phones and the internet are two examples. However, as with all technological advances, there is a drawback. </p>

		<div class="b-column3">
			<p>The development of stone tools and the ability to harness fire are two of the most important examples of how technology helped change human societal behavior and possibly evolution.Both aided the survival of early hunter societies, which created the ancient behaviors for which Homo sapiens are known (the hunter-gatherer model prior  to the development of agricultural societies), effectively changing the course of our evolution by changing the genetics of  entire societies. The introduction of smartphones has greatly simplified our lives. People can now communicate with their loved ones more frequently and easily than ever before thanks to video calls and instant messaging services. Tasks such as creating slides, reading emails, and creating documents no longer necessitate the use of a PC.
			In a nutshell, smartphones and apps have altered the way we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves. Furthermore, the explosive growth of e-commerce and internet-based businesses is directly proportional to the rapid proliferation of smartphones.</p>

		<p>How technology affects learning is one aspect of technology that has had a significant impact on society. It has made learning more interactive and collaborative, allowing people to better engage with the material they are learning and having difficulty with. It also improves your access to resources. With the invention of the internet, we now have access to information 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and you can find almost anything online. Furthermore, it makes it easier for students to complete their assignments. Students can take quizzes and exams more easily, and teachers can hold very effective online classes. It also broadens the scope of the classroom by encouraging self-paced learning. People can learn from YouTube and other social media platforms. This is beneficial to students. <br>
		 Another way technology has influenced society is through communication, specifically how we talk and communicate with one another around the world. Many new electronic communication methods have emerged as a result of technological advancements. For example, there are emails, social networking, the ability to facetime someone on the other side of the world, and video conferencing, which allows you to hold conferences electronically. Finally, technological advancements in the health industry have helped to keep people safe and healthy. There are many innovative apps on phones that allow people to monitor their weight, calorie intake, heart rate, and other health properties at any time of day. <br>
		However, studies show that mobile communication has a negative impact on people's ability to be sociable and make face-to-face contact. Mobile technology has the potential to reduce interpersonal communication and relationships. There is less personal time, and you may find that you do not have enough time for yourself because you are constantly in contact with someone. It can also be distracting from your schoolwork. There is also a loss of privacy because anyone, at any time of day, can find you. To summarize, all of these factors influence how people behave today. Our way of life would not be as complex if technological advancements had not occurred. Today's human behavior is shaped by technological influences.</p>
